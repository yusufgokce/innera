        <!-- What is DBT -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What is Dialectical Behaviour Therapy?</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based cognitive-behavioural treatment developed in the late 1980s by psychologist Dr. Marsha Linehan at the University of Washington. Originally designed to treat individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and chronic suicidality, DBT has since been adapted and validated for a wide range of conditions characterized by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and interpersonal difficulties.</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The term "dialectical" refers to the synthesis of opposites—a core philosophy of DBT. The primary dialectic in DBT is between acceptance and change: accepting yourself and your current reality exactly as it is, while simultaneously working to change patterns that no longer serve you. According to research from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), this balance between validation and change strategies is what makes DBT uniquely effective for individuals who struggle with intense emotions (Dimeff & Koerner, 2007).</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">DBT is structured around teaching four core skill sets: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. These skills provide concrete, practical tools you can use in everyday situations to manage intense emotions, navigate crises, improve relationships, and build a life worth living.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Four Core Skill Modules -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 3px solid #2d2d2d;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Four Core DBT Skills</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">DBT teaches four interconnected skill modules:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">1. Mindfulness</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">The foundation of all DBT skills. Mindfulness teaches you to be present in the moment, observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, and engage fully in your current experience. Skills include "Wise Mind" (balancing emotion and reason), "What" skills (observe, describe, participate), and "How" skills (non-judgmentally, one-mindfully, effectively).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">2. Distress Tolerance</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Skills for surviving crises without making things worse. These include TIPP (Temperature, Intense exercise, Paced breathing, Paired muscle relaxation), ACCEPTS (activities, contributing, comparisons, emotions, pushing away, thoughts, sensations), self-soothing with the five senses, and radical acceptance of painful realities.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">3. Emotion Regulation</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Understanding and managing intense emotions. Skills include identifying and labeling emotions, understanding the function of emotions, reducing emotional vulnerability through self-care (PLEASE skills), increasing positive emotional experiences, and using opposite action and problem-solving to change unwanted emotions.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">4. Interpersonal Effectiveness</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Navigating relationships while maintaining self-respect and effectiveness. Skills include DEAR MAN (describe, express, assert, reinforce, mindful, appear confident, negotiate) for asking for what you need, GIVE (gentle, interested, validate, easy manner) for maintaining relationships, and FAST (fair, no apologies, stick to values, truthful) for self-respect.</p>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Research from the University of Toronto's Department of Psychiatry demonstrates that learning and practicing these skills leads to significant reductions in emotional dysregulation, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal conflict (Links & Shah, 2011, <em>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</em>).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What DBT Helps With -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What DBT Helps With</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">According to the American Psychological Association and Canadian Psychological Association, DBT has strong empirical support for:</p>

            <div class="two-column" style="gap: 2rem;">
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</strong> - The gold standard treatment</li>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Dysregulation</strong> - Intense, rapidly shifting emotions</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Harm and Suicidal Ideation</strong> - Non-suicidal self-injury, chronic suicidality</li>
                        <li><strong>Eating Disorders</strong> - Binge eating disorder, bulimia</li>
                        <li><strong>Substance Use Disorders</strong> - When combined with emotional dysregulation</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</strong> - Especially with emotion dysregulation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Depression</strong> - Treatment-resistant or chronic depression</li>
                        <li><strong>Bipolar Disorder</strong> - Emotion regulation during mood episodes</li>
                        <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders</strong> - Particularly when paired with emotional intensity</li>
                        <li><strong>Anger Management</strong> - Explosive anger, rage episodes</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship Difficulties</strong> - Conflict, instability, communication issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</strong> - Impulsivity and emotional regulation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Research published in the <em>Canadian Journal of Psychiatry</em> demonstrates that DBT is effective across diverse populations and age groups, from adolescents to older adults, and can be delivered in individual, group, and virtual formats (McMain et al., 2017).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Is DBT Right For You -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #fff5f5; border-left: 3px solid #d9a7d7;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Is DBT Right for You?</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">DBT may be particularly helpful if you:</p>

            <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li>Experience intense emotions that feel overwhelming or out of control</li>
                <li>Struggle with impulsive behaviors (spending, substance use, binge eating, self-harm)</li>
                <li>Have difficulty in relationships marked by conflict, instability, or fear of abandonment</li>
                <li>Find it hard to regulate emotions or return to baseline after becoming upset</li>
                <li>Engage in self-destructive behaviors when distressed</li>
                <li>Have been told you're "too sensitive" or "too emotional"</li>
                <li>Want concrete, practical skills you can use immediately</li>
                <li>Have tried other therapies without sufficient improvement</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Important note:</strong> While standard DBT programs typically include both individual therapy and a skills training group, DBT skills can also be effectively taught in individual therapy. We'll discuss the best format for your needs during your initial session.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Evidence & Research Supporting DBT</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">DBT is one of the most extensively researched psychotherapies, with robust evidence for its effectiveness:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Borderline Personality Disorder</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Multiple randomized controlled trials, including landmark Canadian research at CAMH by Dr. Shelley McMain, demonstrate that DBT significantly reduces self-harm, suicidal behavior, emergency room visits, and psychiatric hospitalizations in individuals with BPD (McMain et al., 2009, <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Suicidal Behavior</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Research shows that DBT reduces suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury more effectively than other treatments. A study by Linehan et al. (2006) found that DBT reduced suicide attempts by half compared to treatment-as-usual.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Eating Disorders</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">DBT adapted for eating disorders shows significant reductions in binge eating and purging behaviors. Research from the University of Toronto demonstrates that DBT skills, particularly emotion regulation and distress tolerance, are highly effective for binge eating disorder (Safer, Telch, & Chen, 2009).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Long-Term Outcomes</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Follow-up studies show that improvements gained in DBT are maintained over time. Clients report continued skill use and sustained reductions in emotional dysregulation years after completing treatment (Linehan et al., 2015, <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em>).</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Frequently Asked Questions About DBT</h2>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do I need to attend a DBT skills group?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">While comprehensive DBT includes both individual therapy and a skills training group, DBT skills can also be effectively taught in individual therapy. Many clients benefit from learning DBT skills one-on-one, especially if group settings feel overwhelming or inaccessible. We'll discuss the best format for your needs and circumstances.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How long does DBT take?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Standard DBT programs typically run for 6-12 months, though this varies based on your needs and progress. Some clients benefit from shorter DBT-informed therapy focused on specific skill modules, while others engage in longer-term work. We'll regularly assess your progress and adjust accordingly.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Will I have homework between sessions?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Yes. DBT involves active between-session practice. You'll be asked to practice new skills in your daily life and complete diary cards to track your emotions, behaviors, and skill use. This practice is essential to skill mastery—just like learning a musical instrument or sport, reading about skills isn't enough; you must practice them regularly.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Do I need to have borderline personality disorder to benefit from DBT?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Absolutely not. While DBT was originally developed for BPD, its skills are helpful for anyone struggling with emotional intensity, impulsivity, relationship difficulties, or distress tolerance. You don't need a specific diagnosis to benefit from learning mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness skills.</p>
