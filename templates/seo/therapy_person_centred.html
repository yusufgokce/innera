        <!-- What is Person-Centred Therapy -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What is Person-Centred Therapy?</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Person-Centred Therapy (also called Client-Centred or Rogerian therapy) is a humanistic approach to counseling developed by psychologist Carl Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s. Rooted in a profound respect for human dignity and potential, this approach revolutionized psychotherapy by shifting from the therapist as expert to a collaborative relationship where you, the client, are trusted as the expert on your own experience.</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">According to research from the University of Toronto's Department of Applied Psychology and Human Development, person-centred therapy is grounded in the belief that every person has an innate "actualizing tendency"—a fundamental drive toward growth, healing, and fulfillment of potential. When provided with the right relational conditions, you naturally move toward greater psychological health, authenticity, and wholeness (Rogers, 1961).</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Unlike directive therapies where the therapist diagnoses problems and prescribes solutions, person-centred therapy is non-directive. The therapist creates a safe, accepting environment and trusts in your own wisdom to find your way forward. The relationship itself—characterized by genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding—is the primary vehicle of healing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Core Conditions -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 3px solid #2d2d2d;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Three Core Conditions</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Rogers identified three essential therapeutic conditions that, when present, facilitate growth and healing:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">1. Congruence (Genuineness)</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">The therapist is authentic, transparent, and real in the relationship—not hiding behind a professional facade. What the therapist feels internally matches what they express outwardly. This genuineness creates safety and invites you to be genuine as well.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">2. Unconditional Positive Regard (Acceptance)</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">The therapist accepts you completely, without judgment, conditions, or evaluation. You don't need to be different, better, or "fixed" to be worthy of care and respect. This unconditional acceptance allows you to explore all aspects of yourself without fear of rejection.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">3. Empathic Understanding</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">The therapist deeply understands your internal frame of reference—seeing the world through your eyes, feeling with you, and communicating that understanding. You feel truly heard, seen, and understood at a profound level.</p>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Research from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) demonstrates that these core conditions are not only therapeutic in person-centred therapy but predict positive outcomes across all therapeutic approaches. The quality of the therapeutic relationship is one of the strongest predictors of therapy success (Norcross & Lambert, 2019).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What Person-Centred Therapy Helps With -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What Person-Centred Therapy Helps With</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Person-centred therapy is effective for a wide range of concerns:</p>

            <div class="two-column" style="gap: 2rem;">
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Depression and Low Mood</strong> - Reconnecting with feelings, finding meaning</li>
                        <li><strong>Anxiety and Stress</strong> - Processing emotions in safe, accepting space</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Self-Esteem</strong> - Internalizing unconditional positive regard</li>
                        <li><strong>Identity and Authenticity</strong> - Discovering who you truly are</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship Difficulties</strong> - Learning to relate authentically</li>
                        <li><strong>Life Transitions</strong> - Career changes, relocation, role changes</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Grief and Loss</strong> - Processing emotions without being rushed</li>
                        <li><strong>Trauma</strong> - Gentle, client-paced processing</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Growth</strong> - Self-actualization, meaning-making</li>
                        <li><strong>Existential Concerns</strong> - Purpose, meaning, mortality</li>
                        <li><strong>Feeling "Stuck"</strong> - Reconnecting with inner resources</li>
                        <li><strong>Need for Self-Understanding</strong> - Exploring inner experience</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">According to research published in the <em>Canadian Psychology</em> journal, person-centred therapy is particularly effective when individuals need to feel heard, accepted, and understood—prerequisites for deeper exploration and change (Elliott et al., 2013).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- How Person-Centred Therapy Works -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #fff5f5; border-left: 3px solid #d9a7d7;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">How Person-Centred Therapy Works</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Person-centred therapy operates through several key processes:</p>

            <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Creating a Safe Relational Space:</strong> The therapist provides the core conditions (genuineness, unconditional positive regard, empathy), establishing safety for exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Directive Listening:</strong> Rather than directing, interpreting, or advising, the therapist follows your lead, trusting your process and pace.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection and Clarification:</strong> The therapist reflects back your feelings and meanings, helping you gain clarity and deeper self-understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Conditions of Worth:</strong> As you experience unconditional acceptance, you begin to release "conditions of worth"—beliefs that you're only valuable when you meet certain standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Congruence:</strong> The gap between your "real self" (who you authentically are) and "ideal self" (who you think you should be) narrows. You become more authentic.</li>
                <li><strong>Trusting the Actualizing Tendency:</strong> As defenses soften in the safe therapeutic environment, your innate drive toward growth and wholeness naturally emerges.</li>
                <li><strong>Internalizing Positive Regard:</strong> Over time, you internalize the therapist's unconditional acceptance, developing self-compassion and self-acceptance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Research from York University demonstrates that the experience of being deeply understood and unconditionally accepted produces neurobiological changes associated with emotional regulation, stress reduction, and enhanced wellbeing (Greenberg & Watson, 2006, <em>Emotion-Focused Therapy for Depression</em>).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Evidence & Research -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Evidence & Research Supporting Person-Centred Therapy</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Person-centred therapy has extensive empirical support:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Effectiveness for Depression and Anxiety</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Meta-analyses demonstrate that person-centred therapy produces significant, lasting improvements in depression and anxiety, with effectiveness comparable to CBT and other established treatments (Elliott et al., 2013, <em>Person-Centered & Experiential Psychotherapies</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Self-Concept and Authenticity</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Studies show that person-centred therapy significantly improves self-concept, self-esteem, and congruence (alignment between real and ideal self). Clients report feeling more authentic and self-accepting (Joseph & Worsley, 2005).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Therapeutic Relationship</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Research consistently shows that the quality of the therapeutic relationship—Rogers' core conditions—is one of the best predictors of therapy outcome across all approaches. Person-centred therapy's focus on relationship is empirically validated (Norcross & Wampold, 2019, <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Cultural Sensitivity</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Person-centred therapy's non-directive, respectful stance makes it particularly appropriate across diverse cultural contexts. Canadian research highlights its effectiveness with multicultural populations when therapists demonstrate cultural humility (Moodley & West, 2005).</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Frequently Asked Questions About Person-Centred Therapy</h2>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Will my therapist just sit there and listen without giving advice?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Person-centred therapists don't typically give advice or tell you what to do, but they're far from passive. They actively listen, reflect, ask clarifying questions, and communicate deep understanding. This isn't "just listening"—it's skilled, empathic attunement that helps you access your own wisdom and clarity.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if I need practical solutions or strategies?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Person-centred therapy can be integrated with skills-based approaches when needed. Some therapists blend person-centred principles with other modalities. If you need concrete coping strategies for crisis management, we can incorporate those while maintaining the person-centred relational foundation.</p>

                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">This varies widely. Some clients experience meaningful shifts in a few months, while deeper identity work or complex issues may benefit from longer-term therapy. Person-centred therapy can be brief or long-term depending on your needs. There's no predetermined timeline—we follow your process.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Is unconditional positive regard realistic? What if I've done bad things?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Unconditional positive regard doesn't mean approving of harmful behaviors. It means accepting you as a person of worth regardless of your actions. The therapist separates you (a valuable human being) from your behaviors. This creates safety to honestly examine difficult aspects of yourself without fear of rejection.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Can person-centred therapy help with serious mental health issues?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Yes. Research demonstrates person-centred therapy's effectiveness for depression, anxiety, trauma, and other significant mental health concerns. For some conditions (like severe psychosis or acute suicidality), it may be used as part of a broader treatment approach that includes other interventions.</p>
