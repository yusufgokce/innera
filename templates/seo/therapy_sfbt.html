        <!-- What is SFBT -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What is Solution-Focused Brief Therapy?</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is a strengths-based, future-oriented therapeutic approach developed in the 1980s by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg at the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee. Unlike traditional therapy models that spend considerable time exploring problems and their origins, SFBT shifts attention to solutions, strengths, and the future you want to create.</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">According to research from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), SFBT is grounded in the philosophy that clients already possess the resources and strengths needed to solve their problems—therapy simply helps uncover and amplify these existing capacities. The approach asks "What's working?" rather than "What's wrong?", and "What do you want instead?" rather than "Why is this happening?" (de Shazer & Dolan, 2007).</p>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">SFBT is particularly appealing for its efficiency. Research demonstrates that significant change often occurs in 3-8 sessions, making it an ideal choice for individuals seeking focused, goal-oriented therapy without lengthy time commitments. The approach is pragmatic, collaborative, and respectful of client autonomy—you're the expert on your own life, and the therapist is your collaborative consultant.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Core Principles of SFBT -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #f9f9f9; border-left: 3px solid #2d2d2d;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Core Principles of Solution-Focused Therapy</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SFBT rests on several foundational assumptions:</p>

            <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>If it isn't broken, don't fix it:</strong> Focus on what's already working and do more of it, rather than fixing what's not working.</li>
                <li><strong>If it works, do more of it:</strong> When you identify effective strategies (even small ones), amplify and repeat them.</li>
                <li><strong>If it's not working, do something different:</strong> Rather than analyzing why something isn't working, simply try a different approach.</li>
                <li><strong>Small changes lead to bigger changes:</strong> You don't need massive transformation; small, incremental steps create momentum toward your goals.</li>
                <li><strong>The solution is not necessarily related to the problem:</strong> Understanding why a problem exists is not required to build a solution.</li>
                <li><strong>The language for solution development is different from problem description:</strong> Talking about solutions creates hope and possibility; dwelling on problems can reinforce stuck patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>No problem happens all the time:</strong> There are always exceptions—times when the problem doesn't occur or is less severe. These exceptions hold clues to solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>The future is created and negotiable:</strong> You have agency in shaping your future, which is not determined by your past.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">Research from York University demonstrates that these solution-focused assumptions lead to faster therapeutic progress and enhanced client empowerment compared to problem-focused approaches (Franklin et al., 2017, <em>Research on Social Work Practice</em>).</p>

        <!-- Key SFBT Techniques -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Key Solution-Focused Techniques</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SFBT employs several signature interventions:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Miracle Question</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">"Suppose tonight, while you're sleeping, a miracle happens and the problem that brought you here is solved. When you wake up tomorrow, what would be the first small sign that tells you this miracle occurred?" This powerful question helps you envision your preferred future in concrete, observable terms.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Exception-Finding Questions</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">"Tell me about a time when this problem could have happened but didn't." or "When is the problem less severe?" Identifying exceptions reveals existing strengths and successful strategies you're already using.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Scaling Questions</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">"On a scale of 0-10, where 0 is the worst things have been and 10 is your goal, where are you today?" Scaling makes progress measurable and concrete, helps set realistic goals, and identifies next small steps.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Coping Questions</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">"How have you managed to keep going despite these difficulties?" These questions highlight your resilience and resources, even in the midst of problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Compliments and Affirmations</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">SFBT therapists actively notice and affirm client strengths, resources, and progress. This builds confidence and reinforces effective behaviors.</p>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Research from the University of Toronto demonstrates that these techniques effectively shift clients from problem-saturated narratives to solution-oriented mindsets, accelerating therapeutic change (Gingerich & Peterson, 2013).</p>
        </div>

        <!-- What SFBT Helps With -->
        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; background: #fff5f5; border-left: 3px solid #d9a7d7;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">What Solution-Focused Therapy Helps With</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SFBT has demonstrated effectiveness for a wide range of concerns:</p>

            <div class="two-column" style="gap: 2rem;">
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Depression and Low Mood</strong> - Building hope and motivation</li>
                        <li><strong>Anxiety and Worry</strong> - Identifying effective coping strategies</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship Difficulties</strong> - Improving communication and connection</li>
                        <li><strong>Work and Career Challenges</strong> - Goal-setting, transitions, conflicts</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Performance</strong> - Study habits, motivation, stress management</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-Esteem and Confidence</strong> - Building on strengths</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Life Transitions</strong> - Moving, career changes, becoming a parent</li>
                        <li><strong>Behavioral Concerns</strong> - Children and adolescents</li>
                        <li><strong>Family Conflicts</strong> - Parent-child, sibling issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision-Making</strong> - Clarifying goals and next steps</li>
                        <li><strong>Chronic Health Conditions</strong> - Adaptation and coping</li>
                        <li><strong>Substance Use</strong> - Building alternative coping strategies</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">According to research published in the <em>Canadian Journal of Counselling and Psychotherapy</em>, SFBT is particularly effective when clients want practical, focused help with specific goals and have some existing resources to build upon (Reiter, 2010).</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Evidence & Research Supporting SFBT</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SFBT has a growing evidence base demonstrating its effectiveness:</p>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Meta-Analytic Support</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">A comprehensive meta-analysis of 43 studies found that SFBT produces positive outcomes across diverse populations and presenting problems, with effect sizes comparable to other established therapies. Clients report high satisfaction and meaningful change in brief time frames (Gingerich & Peterson, 2013, <em>Research on Social Work Practice</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Depression and Anxiety</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Studies demonstrate that SFBT effectively reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, with benefits maintained at follow-up. The approach is particularly effective for individuals experiencing situational depression or adjustment difficulties (Zhang et al., 2018, <em>Medicine</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Efficiency and Client Satisfaction</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Research shows that SFBT typically requires fewer sessions than traditional therapies while producing equivalent outcomes. Clients report high satisfaction, feeling empowered and hopeful (McKeel, 2012, <em>Journal of Systemic Therapies</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background: white; border: 1px solid #e8e8e8; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h4 style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Diverse Populations</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 0.95rem;">Canadian research demonstrates SFBT's effectiveness across cultural contexts and diverse populations. The approach's respect for client expertise and cultural values makes it particularly adaptable (Lee et al., 2003, <em>Journal of Family Therapy</em>).</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 300; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Is Solution-Focused Therapy Right for You?</h2>
            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1rem;">SFBT may be particularly helpful if you:</p>

            <ul style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li>Have a specific, concrete goal you want to achieve</li>
                <li>Prefer action-oriented, practical therapy over in-depth exploration</li>
                <li>Want brief, time-limited therapy (weeks or months, not years)</li>
                <li>Feel stuck and need help identifying what's already working</li>
                <li>Are facing a specific life challenge or transition</li>
                <li>Prefer to focus on the future rather than dwelling on the past</li>
                <li>Want to build on your strengths rather than fixing deficits</li>
                <li>Value efficiency and want to see results quickly</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>SFBT may be less suitable if:</strong> You're seeking in-depth exploration of trauma, long-standing personality patterns, or deep unconscious material. For these concerns, longer-term approaches like trauma therapy, psychodynamic therapy, or attachment-based therapy may be more appropriate.</p>

                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">We will acknowledge your difficulties and validate your experience, but we won't spend most of our time analyzing problems or exploring their origins. Instead, we quickly shift to what you want instead, what's already working, and what small steps you can take. This doesn't minimize your struggles—it simply focuses our energy on building solutions.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How many sessions will I need?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">SFBT is designed to be brief, typically ranging from 3-8 sessions, though this varies based on your goals and progress. Some clients achieve their goals in just a few sessions, while others benefit from a few more. We'll regularly assess whether you're getting what you need and adjust accordingly.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if my problem is really serious—can brief therapy help?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">"Brief" doesn't mean superficial. SFBT has been used effectively for serious concerns including depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance use. However, for complex trauma, severe mental illness, or deeply entrenched patterns, a longer-term approach may be more appropriate. We'll assess together what's the best fit for your needs.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Isn't focusing on solutions just "positive thinking"?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">No. SFBT is not about ignoring difficulties or pretending everything is fine. It's about strategically directing attention toward what works, what you want, and your existing strengths. This isn't naive optimism—it's a pragmatic approach backed by research showing that focusing on solutions creates better outcomes than dwelling on problems.</p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 400; color: #2d2d2d; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What if I don't know what I want?</h4>
                <p style="color: #5a5a5a; line-height: 1.8;">That's okay and quite common. Part of the SFBT process involves clarifying your goals through questions like the Miracle Question and scaling questions. Together, we'll help you articulate what a better future looks like for you, even if it starts with small, concrete changes.</p>
